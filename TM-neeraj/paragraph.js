    "At first the professor scowled with concern. But then he said, that's all right. Run to my house. Tell my wife to give you one of my shirts. \"Mrs. Esputa quickly fetched one of her husband's white shirts. But when Philip put it on, she began to exclaim, \"Oh, dear! Gracious!\" The shirt was so large that Philip was almost lost in it. Hastily Mrs. Esputa found a box of pins. In a twinkling, her nimble fingers pinned enough tucks in the shirt to make it fit Philip. They both heaved a big sigh of relief when the job was finished. Then, free from anxiety, Philip hurried back to the school. The concert finally began, and soon it was time for Philip's also. Stood up, placed the violin under his chin, and raised his bow. With horror he felt a pin pulling loose in the back of his shirt. But he recalled how many pins had been inserted in the shirt and thought, \"Losing one won't matter. \"Philip started to play. At first his right arm moved back and forth slowly, then more swiftly. Before long the pins that were holding his collar pulled out, The loose, large shirt collar began to creep up the back of Philip\'s head. Then the unruly sleeves grew looser and longer. Suddenly the shirt fell away from his neck. The audience began to laugh. In embarrassed confusion, Philip forgot what he was playing and stopped completely. The disaster so upset him that he rushed off the stage and sulked in a dark corner. Fighting back tears, he mumbled gloomily, \"I wish I were dead Refreshments were served after the concert, but Philip was too busy to have any. He mingled with the crowd as quickly as he could, hoping to avoid Mr. Esputa. After a wistful look at the ice cream, Phillip was about to slink out when a booming voice behind him scoffed, \"Well, Philip, you made a nice mess of it. \" Philip turned and found himself face to face with his glowering teacher. With no sympathy for poor Philip, Mr. Esputa continued unreasonably, \"No refreshments for you! You shouldn\'t have spent the day playing ball. You should have been preparing for the important work of the evening. You ought to be ashamed! MP hung his head, sighed heavily, and trudged home. The incident at Such an impression on him that he always remembered it. He never gain tried to mix work and play. ",
    "Now we have devised robots that are much more complicated than any other machines we have ever had. They are complicated enough to do jobs that until now only human beings could do, but that are too simple for the marvellous brains we all have. The robots, even though they are smarter than other machines, are still only capable of very simple tasks - the kind of tasks human beings ought not to waste their time doing. In that case, why not let the robots do it? Why shouldn't human beings do other and better things? After all, whenever there is an important new invention, some jobs are lost. When the automobile came into use, there was a gradual, but steady, loss of jobs that involved horses. There were fewer stables, fewer manufacturers of buggies and wagons, fewer whips, and fewer spurs. On the other hand, think of the jobs the automobile created. Think of all the garages that came into being, all the auto mechanics needed, all the tyre manufacturing, highway building, oil well drilling. Automobiles created hundreds of times as many jobs as they destroyed. That's the way it will be with robots too. Lots of assembly-line jobs will vanish, but think of all the jobs needed to design robots, manufacture their parts, put them together, install them, and keep them in good repair, There will be many times as many jobs coming into being as are destroyed. The jobs that are destroyed will be very dull ones anyway, so dull that even a robot can do them. The jobs that will be created will be interesting ones that will stretch the mind. Of course, there is a catch. We can't just tell a person who has been working on an assembly line for twenty-five years to stop and take a job designing robots instead. It takes a special kind of education to be able to work with robots, and assembly-line worker won't have it. If we are going to have a large changeover in types of jobs, there will have to be a careful programme of retraining and re-education for people with old-style jobs. It will have to be done even if they take rather simple new-style ones. That Will be expensive and hard, but it will have to be done. There are also sure to be people who are too old, or too beaten down by the dull job they had to do all their lives, to be able to take advantage of retraining. ",
    "Switzerland is the most peaceful country in the world. Although always prepared to face any hazard of war, it has never faced any hostile army since the Swiss Confederation was founded in 1815, nor has its army ever fired at anyone in aggression. Switzerland is, therefore, totally free of the ravages of war. No other European country can claim this distinction. Most of Switzerland's 16,000 square mile area is a continuous, rolling lush countryside of pastures, Vineyards and grain farms, except one third of the mountainous and extremely beautiful region. Three quarters of the population lives in small towns and villages which remain exquisitely medieval in their architecture and external appearance. At very short notice, it can convert itself into an army bristling with military defence, i.e. a whole nation in arms. People of Switzer- land can boast that they do not have an army, but they themselves are an army. The unique aspect of the military preparedness of Switzerland is its constant readiness for facing a nuclear attack or the consequences of a nuclear war in its neighbourhood. Dr. Morgellier, the Chief military spokesman told sometime back that .80% of the population of Switzerland can be moved into under-ground shelters within a few hours. Every aspect of the life of the citizens is tightly supervised by the local police. As a consequence, there is 100% compliance with three specific instructions: one is that every household must keep a reserve stock of approximately two months requirements of food and daily provisions. Secondly, the entire male population must take part in civil defence exercises and must be constantly available for military duty. Thirdly, everyone must be ready at all times with one's arms. The government issue arms and ammunition to each household. All men between 20 and 50 years of age must do military service and until the age of 32, must attend military colleges for 20 days every year and one at least for 90 days. The result is that although Switzerland's regular or standing army is only 65,000 strong, it can put 10 per cent of the population or 650,000 men in the field within 48 hours and all the rest in a few days more. Thus, Switzerland's concern with defence is such that outside observers describe it as an obsession. Words. ",
    "When the man first began to think, he asked himself the deepest of all questionsâ€“a question which you have undoubtedly asked yourself many times: What is the meaning of Life? What is it all about? Where are we all going? What drives men ever forward to work and worry? And now there's this other big question-a newer question which is beginning to force itself into our notice. One that is not ages old. That has not been with us since man first began to think. It is: Where is Science Taking Us? First, where is science taking us with regard to ethical and spiritual values? We know what it is doing with regard to material things, for material things are its daily business; but what is it doing with regard to non-material things? If the answer were 'nothing at all,' that would be bad enough; but the actual answer is 'less than nothing.' Here science is actually doing less than nothing. Its material teaching has been so over-emphasized that many people are floundering and wondering whether after all man is but a machine animated by forces over which he has no control. Let's concentrate on material things, the things that form the very stronghold of science. Look at the machine, for instance. This is the age of the machine. Machine are everywhere-in the fields, in the factory, in the home, in the street, in the city, in the country, everywhere. To fly, it is not necessary to have wings; there are machines. To swim under the sea, it is not necessary to have gills, there are machines. To kill our fellow men in overwhelming numbers, there are machines. Petrol machines alone provide ten times more power than all human beings in the world. In the busiest countries, each individual has six hundred human slaves in his machines. What are the consequences of this abnormal power? Before the war, it looked as though it might be possible, for the first time in history, to provide food and clothing and shelter fort the teeming population of the world-every man, woman and child. This would have been one of the greatest triumphs of science. And yet, many a time especially during the war we have seen the world crammed full of food and people hungry. For that's the way of science and the machine age. Science produces the goods, it makes the goods, but has no control over the consequences. ",
    "After being in exile for 50 years the question is becoming more and more important among Tibetans. Will the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, ever return to his home country? The Chinese authorities are expecting protests throughout Tibet and have sent police and army units into the region. The government has also forbidden foreigners to enter the region. In the meantime the 74-year old Dalai Lama does not expect to return to Tibet anytime soon. He admits that he has not succeeded in getting Beijing to give the region more rights. The Tibetan leader accuses the Chinese government of committing cultural genocide and fears that Tibet's ancient culture may disappear forever. On the other hand the Beijing government has claimed that since the Dalai Lama was overthrown and left the country 50 years ago Tibet has become a more modern society. The Dalai Lama still hopes to return to Tibet one day. When that day comes he has promised to return his power to create a local government under Chinese rule. At the same time he is afraid that his return from exile may lead to more anti-Chinese feelings and discontent may spread. In Tibet the Dalai Lama is the central figure around which everything revolves. Many Tibetans want him back, even if it means more trouble with the Chinese. However, there may not be very much time left. The Dalai Lama is getting older and his health is not always at its best. Last year he spent many weeks in an Indian hospital. He has also called off meetings, lectures and trips to other countries. Political experts think that Beijing is not really looking for a solution to the issue, but simply waiting for the Dalai Lama to die. His successor would not be as popular as he is. The Chinese, however, are aware that they shouldn't provoke the people as they stand behind their Dalai Lama.",
    "A glacier is a mass of thick ice that stays frozen and can move slowly over land. During the Ice Age, which ended about 10,000 years ago, many parts of the world were covered with glaciers. Almost all of Canada and the northern parts of Europe, like Scandinavia and Siberia were covered with ice. Today, the large ice masses of the Ice Age are gone but there are still glaciers all over the world. Most of them exist high up in mountain regions but even around the equator there are places where snow falls and never melts. Glaciers can form in places where the snow that falls in winter months cannot completely melt away during the summer. The layers of snow get thicker and thicker. When it melts and freezes over and over again it turns into ice. This ice can become very heavy and starts to move down valleys. The speed at which glaciers move depends on the climate. When it gets colder glaciers get bigger and move downwards. When it gets warmer over a longer period of time glaciers melt and retreat back to the tops of the mountains. In some cases glaciers can move up to 1 km or even more every year. When a glacier moves over land slowly it picks up rock and dirt and carries these materials along with it. When a glacier comes to a standstill it piles up this material to form moraines. The gigantic weight and power of glaciers can even reshape mountains. This happened to the Alps and other mountain ranges during the Ice Age. The earth's glaciers hold about 75% of the world's freshwater. Many people think that if temperatures around the world increase, more and more ice will melt. Sea levels will go up and flood many coastal areas. Valley glaciers grow high up in the mountains. They form in places where it stays cold the whole year. ",
    "Music can be the most important and powerful things of anyone life who loves to listen or play music and know its importance in their life. One who listen or play music never get fed up of any problems in the life. It helps in distressing and relaxing the mind as well as motivates to do something better in the life. Many people love to listen and play music at many occasions or events. Some of the people become used to of listening music in their all time such as in the office, home on the way, etc. It keeps away from all the problems of life and gives solutions. Now-a-days, there is a trend of playing slow music in the offices of big companies while employees are working in order to keep mind fresh, peaceful, concentrate, bring positive thoughts as well as increasing the performance of the employees. I got my music loving habit in the generation from parents and grandparents because my father and grandfather were very fond of listening music. Slow music always run in my home from morning till night. I don't know much about the musical compositions but I generally like to listen music whenever I travel or during my study time. On the weekend, we dance, listen music or play music with family at home or at picnic on any favorite place. Music touches my soul and spirit and makes me realize that I have no any problems in this world. Music is very powerful and has ability to convey positive messages to all sorts of emotion without telling and asking anything to anyone. It is voiceless however tells everything and shares all the problems more than the human being. Music has inspiring and promoting nature which increases the concentration power of the human being by removing all the negative thoughts. Music is the thing which helps us in re-memorizing our good memories of the past with our loved ones and dear ones. It has no limitations, drawbacks and guidelines; it only needs anyone to listen or play passionately with full devotion. When we listen music, it brings amazing feeling in the heart and mind which connects our spirit to the supernatural power of God. There is a very true saying about the music that\"music imitates life and life imitates music\". Being inspired, I also started learning music and playing guitar and hope would be a good music player a day. ",
    "I used to go to thrift stores with my friends. We'd take the train into Boston, and go to The Garment District, which is this huge vintage clothing warehouse. Everything is arranged by color, and somehow that makes all of the clothes beautiful. It's kind of like if you went through the wardrobe in the Narnia books, only instead of finding Aslan and the White Witch and horrible Eustace, you found this magic clothing world-instead of talking animals, there were feather boas and wedding dresses and bowling shoes, and paisley shirts and Doc Martens and everything hung up on racks so that first you have black dresses, all together, like the world's largest indoor funeral, and then blue dresses-all the blues you can imagine-and then red dresses and so on. Pink-reds and orangey reds and purple-reds and exit-light reds and candy reds. Sometimes I would close my eyes and Natasha and Natalie and Jake would drag me over to a rack and rub a dress against my hand. \"Guess what color this is.\" We had this theory that you could learn how to tell, just by feeling, what color something was. For example, if you're sitting on a lawn, you can tell what color green the grass is, with your eyes closed, depending on how silky-rubbery it feels. With clothing, stretchy velvet stuff always feels red when your eyes are closed, even if it's not red. Natasha was always best at guessing colors, but Natasha is also best at cheating at games and not getting caught. One time we were looking through kid's t-shirts and we found a Muppets t-shirt that had belonged to Natalie in third grade. We knew it belonged to her, because it still had her name inside, where her mother had written it in permanent marker, when Natalie went to summer camp. Jake bought it back for her, because he was the only one who had money that weekend. He was the only one who had a job. Maybe you're wondering what a guy like Jake is doing in The Garment District with a bunch of girls. The thing about Jake is that he always has a good time, no matter what he's doing. He likes everything, and he likes everyone, but he likes me best of all. Wherever he is now, I bet he's having a great time and wondering when I'm going to show up. I'm always running late. But he knows that. We had this theory that things have life cycles, the way that people do. ",
    "Bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky-line and dip immediately from view. The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more. But all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe.

    "Amphibians are animals that live on land and in water. They were the ancestors of today's reptiles and mammals and the first vertebrates to appear on land, about 350 million years ago. Over 4000 types of amphibians live in almost all regions of the world, especially in hot and humid areas. Among the most popular amphibians are frogs and salamanders. Amphibians can grow to different sizes, smaller ones are only 1 cm in length and larger ones can reach up to one and a half metres. Those that live mostly on land breathe through their lungs, others, which live mainly in water have gills. An amphibian's skin is wet and often covered with a sticky fluid that prevents it from becoming dry. Some species lose their outer skin layer several times a year. Others produce poison that protects them from enemies. Many amphibians are colourful animals that blend in with their surroundings. Some amphibians, for example frogs have thick bodies and four powerful legs that they use to leap and swim. Toads have shorter legs than frogs and a drier skin. They have no tail. Salamanders are amphibians with a short body and a long tail, which they can grow if they lose them. These creatures , which are found mostly in temperate climate zones , live near rivers and under rocks. Caecilians look a lot like worms. They have long thin bodies without legs. These tropical amphibians are nearly blind because their eyes are covered with skin or bone. Only few of them live in water. Amphibians are cold blooded animals. Their body temperature is about the same as their surroundings. Most animals move to other places to adjust their body temperature if it gets too hot or too cold. Depending on the climate, amphibians hibernate or are inactive during the year when it gets too hot or cold. They eat many different kinds of food including insects and worms. Most amphibians lay their eggs in the water. Young animals have fish-like features. After living as a larva they grow gills which allow them to breathe under water. During a phase called metamorphosis a young amphibian develops from a larva into an adult. This stage can take from a few weeks to several years. Some amphibians then lose their gills and develop lungs for breathing. Often they also change their appearance.",
